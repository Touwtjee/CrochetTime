            	<p class="narrative">The blanket consists of puffy little flowers that are joined as-you-go. Because of the gradient, gauge and tension are quite important as you don’t want to end up with more or fewer motifs and thus a wider or smaller blanket. However, if you don’t want to be bothered by checking your gauge there are ways around this. I’ve mentioned them in the pattern. The pattern is perfect for adventurous beginners or intermediate crocheters. The ‘featured’ stitch in this pattern is the popcorn stitch, which creates a beautiful puffy flower. It’s one of my favourite stitches!</p>

Each little flower is bursting with colours, changing as-you-go. You don’t have to think about the colours though, the yarn does all the hard work for you. The blanket measures 100 x 75cm (40 x 29.5in) but it’s easy to change the size of the blanket.</p>
